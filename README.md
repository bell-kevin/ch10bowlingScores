# ch10bowlingScores

Create a project with an array for 10 bowling scores. Write a function that accepts a pointer to the array to ask the user for the bowling scores. Write another function that accepts a pointer to the array to calculate the average of those scores and return the result to the main function to display. Write another function that accepts a pointer to the array to find the highest score in the array and return the result to the main function to display. Use pointer notation throughout the program.

Create a table of test cases BEFORE you write and run your project to calculate the correct results for different sets of bowling scores. Create 3 test cases. Run your code, enter the data from each test case, and compare your results to those test cases. Take screenshots of all 3 results.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots, the table of test cases  AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
